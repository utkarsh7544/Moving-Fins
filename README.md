# Moving-Fins
A fin mechanism to control a rocket system.

# Overview
The primary objective of this project is to design and develop an advanced moving fin mechanism for a rocket, enhancing its aerodynamic control and stability during flight. Total 4 fins were fabricated around a central cylinder, each of them were connected to a sg90 servo motor. An Arduino Nano microcontroller along with an MPU-6050 was used to control the movement of the fins. The system was powered using a pain of lithium ion batteries.
